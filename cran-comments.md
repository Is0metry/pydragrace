## Test environments

## R CMD check results

R CMD check done via `devtools::check()`, resulting in 0 errors, 0 warnings, 0 notes. There was a polite suggestion to eschew the middle initial in the DESCRIPTION file. However, I'd like to keep it because my name is quite common and I prefer to be seen, professionally, as Steven V. Miller.
