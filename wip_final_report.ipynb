    "RuPaul's Drag Race is a competition reality show which began airing in 2009 on LogoTV, a small premium cable channel geared towards LGBTQ+ audiences. Since then, it has become an international phenomenon, winning multiple Emmy award and spawning multiple spinoffs and international versions. It has moved channels twice, first to VH1, and then to its current home on MTV, where it is now airing its fifteenth season. Winners of the show have toured internationally, [starred on Broadway in Drag](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jerylbrunner/2023/02/13/jinkx-monsoon-makes-a-big-splash-on-broadway-in-chicago/?sh=d9ebd493e4e2) and even gone on to host international versions of the show. The show has pretty much singlehandedly catapulted drag into the spotlight and given wider visibility to this distinctly queer artform.\n",

    "In case that introduction wasn't clear, I'm a **HUGE** fan of the show. I have seen every season from 3 onward, have a frankly alarming amount of merch from my favorite queens, and have seen more of them than I can count live. I've had my own intuitive methods of attempting to divine the winning queen. However, as my crystal ball is in the shop, I'm going to try to see if I can build a predictive model to figure it out for me! \n",
