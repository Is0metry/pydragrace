# dragracer: Data Sets for RuPaul's Drag Race

<img src="man/figures/dragracer-sticker.png" alt="The dragracer hexlogo" align="right" width="200" style="padding: 0 15px; float: right;"/>

`dragracer` is an R package of data sets for all available seasons of RuPaul's Drag Race, excluding All Stars. It's updated at the end of each season. I have [a blog post that describes these data](http://svmiller.com/blog/2019/02/dragracer-rupauls-drag-race-analysis/) in some detail, which showcases some of the things you can do with it. I offer this R package as a love letter of a kind to RuPaul's Drag Race and all the contestants that have appeared on it. We have no choice but to stan, especially Jinkx Monsoon. Jinkx is the GOAT. Sasha Velour is Champaign-Urbana's greatest export since REO Speedwagon. Kameron Michaels should've won Season 10.

## Installation

The goal is to get this on CRAN, eventually. Until then, you can install the development version of `dragracer` from Github via the `devtools` package. I suppose using the `remotes` package would work as well.

```r
devtools::install_github("svmiller/dragracer")
```

## Usage

The data right now contain three data sets. `rpdr_ep` is episode-level data for all available seasons. These include observations about twhen the episode aired, the number of queens in the episode, mini-challenge winners, who appeared in the bottom for a given episode, and who was sent home. `rpdr_contestants` is a data frame of contestant-level information, including the contestant's age, purported date of birth, hometown, and how they fared across all episodes in their particular season. `rpdr_contep` is episode-contestant-level data about how each contestant fared in a particular episode in which they were. You can read more through this command.

```r
data(package = "dragracer")
```

The ensuing output will look like this.

```{r, echo=F, eval=T}
alldata <- data(package = "dragracer")
library(knitr)
library(tibble)

tibble(`**Object Name**` = alldata$results[, "Item"],
       `**Title/Description**` = alldata$results[, "Title"]) %>%
  kable(., format="markdown")
```

Here is a simple scraping job to provide more information (by way of the `description` field in the associated R Documentation file).

```{r, echo=F, eval=T}
getdescript <- function(package){
  db <- tools::Rd_db(package)
  descript <- lapply(db,function(x) {
    tags <- tools:::RdTags(x)
    if("\\description" %in% tags){
      out <- paste(unlist(x[which(tags=="\\description")]),collapse="")
    }
    else
      out <- NULL
    invisible(out)
  })
  gsub("\n","",unlist(descript))
}

descripts <- getdescript("dragracer")

tibble(`**Object Name**` = alldata$results[, "Item"],
       `**Description**` = descripts)  %>%
  kable(., format="markdown")

```
