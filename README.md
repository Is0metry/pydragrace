# pydragrace: A data-driven exploration of RuPaul's Drag Race

## Introduction
Which queens reign supreme? That is the question that I am looking to answer with this exploration of RuPaul's Drag Race. This is an exploration of the dataset taken from [svmiller's dragracer dataset](https://github.com/svmiller/dragracer) and augmented with data gathered from being a fan of the show for many years. The end goal is to build a model to predict winners given as few contestants as possible. Will we succeed? Who knows, but whatever the findings, it's sure to slay the house down boots yaas gawd mawma ockurrrrrrrrr!
