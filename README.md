This is a work in progress: an R package for RuPaul's Drag Race data from Season 1 through 10. Please forgive me.

To get the current development version from Github:

``` r
## install dev version of dragracer from github
devtools::install_github("svmiller/dragracer")

## load dragracer package
library(dragracer)
```
