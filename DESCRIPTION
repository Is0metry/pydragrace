Description: These are data sets for the hit TV show, RuPaul's Drag Race. 
    Data right now include episode-level data, contestant-level data, and 
    episode-contestant-level data. This is a work in progress, and a love letter
    of a kind to RuPaul's Drag Race and the performers that have appeared on the show.
    This may not be the most productive use of my time, but I have tenure and what 
    are you going to do about it? I think there is at least some value in this package
    if it allows the show's fandom to learn more about the R programming language 
    around its contents.
