Title: dragracer: Data Ssets for RuPaul's Drag Race
Version: 0.1.4
Author: Steven V. Miller
Maintainer: Steven V. Miller <steven.v.miller@gmail.com>
Description: This is an R package for data sets pertaining to RuPaul's Drag Race. 
    Data right now include episode-level data, contestant-level data, and 
    episode-contestant-level data. This is a work in progress, and a love letter
    of a kind to RuPaul's Drag Race and the performers that have appeared on the show.
    This may not be the most productive use of my time, but I have tenure and what 
    are you going to do about it?
